## Motivation

Discussions about AI automation in legal and policy contexts often assume that replacing human tasks preserves institutional stability as long as outputs remain accurate and costs decline. This note records a concern that keeps recurring across different contexts:

Some forms of human work do not primarily produce outputs. Instead, they **absorb ambiguity, error, and escalation pressure**. When automation replaces these functions without structural compensation, institutional pressure does not disappear—it migrates downstream, often into legal and regulatory systems.

The purpose of this note is to isolate that mechanism in a simple form, without proposing a full theory or solution.

## Task substitution vs. buffering functions

Automation debates usually treat work as a set of discrete, substitutable units:
- a task is identified,
- performance is measured,
- and substitution is evaluated based on efficiency or accuracy.

This framing works for genuinely substitutable work. But it fails for roles whose main function is **stabilization rather than production**.

Examples of buffering work include:
- interpreting ambiguous rules in borderline cases,
- delaying escalation to supervisors or legal counsel,
- resolving issues informally before they become formal disputes,
- distributing responsibility across roles to prevent premature blame concentration,
- maintaining institutional slack for exceptions and irregular cases.

These functions tend to be invisible precisely because they prevent failures from becoming visible.

## What changes when buffering work is automated

When AI systems replace the visible layer of task execution while buffering capacity declines, a characteristic pattern appears:

1. Local performance metrics improve or remain stable.
2. Fewer humans remain positioned to absorb ambiguity or contain errors.
3. Issues that were previously resolved informally reach formal legal or regulatory channels.
4. Responsibility becomes harder to allocate, as control is distributed across developers, deployers, and operators.
5. Legal and regulatory responses become increasingly reactive.

Notably, this pattern does not depend on AI malfunction. It can occur even when systems perform as intended.

## A concrete illustration: internal compliance review

Internal compliance review is often described as a computer-based task that can be automated. In practice, compliance teams frequently function as institutional buffers:

- interpreting rules under uncertainty,
- preventing unnecessary escalation,
- applying institutional memory to recurring edge cases,
- slowing execution where legal risk is unclear.

If AI systems replace the surface-level compliance task (e.g. generating compliant-looking documentation or approvals) while removing human buffering roles, organizations may experience fewer internal frictions but greater downstream exposure when issues eventually surface.

From a legal perspective, the failure appears discrete. Structurally, it reflects the gradual removal of buffering capacity.

## Relevance for liability and AI agents

This mechanism matters for both principal-based liability approaches and proposals to require AI agents to follow the law.

Formal legal compliance by an AI system does not guarantee institutional stability if buffering functions have been removed. In some cases, stricter rule-following may accelerate escalation rather than restore absorption capacity.

This suggests that evaluating AI systems solely in terms of compliance or task performance may miss an important source of legal risk.

## A diagnostic question

One question that helps surface this failure mode is:

> Which human roles currently prevent ambiguity and error from becoming legally visible harms, and what happens when automation removes those roles without replacement?

This question can be asked ex ante, before failures occur.

## Status

This note records a single structural concern. It does not aim to:
- offer a comprehensive framework,
- propose specific regulatory reforms,
- or predict automation timelines.

It is shared as a working diagnostic that may or may not generalize across contexts.
