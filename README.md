# Institutional Buffers & AI Automation

This repository contains a set of research notes examining how AI automation reshapes institutional stability—particularly how replacing certain forms of human work can shift pressure into legal and regulatory systems even when AI systems appear effective.

The focus here is not on model performance, alignment, or bias in isolation, but on **institutional functions that absorb ambiguity, contain error, and manage escalation**—and what happens when those functions are silently removed through automation.

---

## What this work does

- Identifies **buffering functions** in human roles that are typically invisible to legal analysis because they prevent failures from becoming formally legible.
- Explains how automating these functions can cause **pressure migration** into courts, regulators, and principals.
- Offers **diagnostic lenses** for evaluating AI deployment beyond task substitution metrics.
- Contributes to discussions around AI agents, liability allocation, and law-following AI by highlighting structural failure modes that arise without any explicit rule violation.

---

## What this work does not do

- It is not a comprehensive theory of law, AI, or institutions.
- It does not propose jurisdiction-specific regulations or doctrinal reforms.
- It does not argue for or against automation in general.
- It does not attempt to formalize or exhaustively define all relevant mechanisms.

The notes here are intentionally partial and problem-focused.

## Scope and status

The materials in this repository are **stabilized extracts** from a broader ongoing research program on institutional pressure, responsibility, and automation. They are shared as independent diagnostics rather than as a complete framework.

Some notes are written for specific research or policy contexts (e.g. law & AI discussions) and should be read as **interfaces**, not as full representations of the underlying research system.

## Repository structure

- `/notes/`  
  Short research notes exploring specific mechanisms or examples (e.g. automation and compliance review, buffering work, escalation dynamics).

Additional material may be added selectively. This repository is not intended to be comprehensive or frequently updated.
